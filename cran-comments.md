## Note:

* This submission is a revision from a recent submission that was rejected.  I have updated the DESCRIPTION file to include a reference (though unfortunately no arxiv or doi is available; it is a thesis) with appropriately formatted url, fixed the T/F vs. TRUE/FALSE issue, and included a \dontshow example for the system's automated checking process.  The \dontshow example runs the mapPheno function with a small subset of data.


## Test environments

* OS X El Capitan v.10.11.6, R 3.4.2
* Windows 7 (x64), R 3.4.2
